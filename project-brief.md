# Object Oriented Computing - Project Assessment
For this project you are required to design and develop a Java application that demonstrates the 4 Pillars of OOP (i.e., Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction).
The application must manage objects of the type you have chosen from the `Project Object Choice List`, which is available on the Moodle page. You will use an array to store and manage the objects.

## ‚ö° Minimum Project Requirments
- You must use the Project GitHub Repository provided to you on the Moodle page. No other development set up will be acceptable. This link to create your repository can be found under the `Project Assessment` section on Moodle. You need to click on the link to create your repository. This repository will contain all documentation, application code and any resources (e.g., input and output files, images etc) used by your application. Please note, no materials outside of your GitHub repository are gradable. Using another GitHub repository or not using GitHub at all for this project will incur a penalty of 60%. If you do not understand what is meant by this, then email me before you begin your project.
- This application must be developed using GitHub Codespaces.
- Project development must be tracked on GitHub via regular commits. Your GitHub repository must have at minimum two commits per week, if not I may contact you for a live project demonstration. The project will be capped at 40% if you fail to attend this meeting.    
- The README file should contain clear instructions for compiling, deploying, and running the application. It should also briefly outline the nature of the project and detail the set of features it contains. All sections of the README template must be filled out and add more sections if you please. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Minimum Feature Requirements
The application must incorporate, at minimum, the following features:
- Your chosen object must have 4 instance variables of 4 different types (e.g., String, int, float, boolean).
- Your porject code must utilise the 4 Pillars of OOP (i.e., Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction) 
- Methods to add, delete, count total and find objects in an array.

## üìù Coding Standards
- Your code must compile
- Consistent code formatting
- Code commentary is essential. Comment every class and method at minimum. 

## ‚≠ê Enhanced Features
To achieve a higher grade, consider implementing:
- Go above and beyond the minimum by adding extra methods (e.g., a method to list all objects by their unique ID in the array) and features (e.g., ask the user to choose the size of the array) to your application which you have researched yourself. Document any extra methods or features in your README.
- Create an animated gif of you using your application and add it to your Readme.
- Create an executable jar file that opens your application independently and include this in your GitHub repository. 

## üìä Project Submission Process
You **must** folow this subission process carefully. If you miss any part, especially the screencast, you will be penalised.    

### 1. Screencast Demonstration
- 5-minute screen recording using [MS Stream](https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/stream)
- Give a brief code walkthrough highlghting places where you expended most of your effort
- Demonstrate your app running and its operation  
- Highlight any additional functionality you implemented
- **MAKE SURE YOUR SCREENCAST IS ACCESSABLE BY ME**. CHECK STREAMS/OneDrive PERMISSIONS and make sure it can be seen by me.

### 2. Moodle Submission
- [Download a copy of your final Git repository from the GitHub website.](https://youtube.com/shorts/4bDLccFjQyc?si=dWUDWoW4B_tnADty)
- In the submission area on Moodle, where you will upoad your zipped project, you will see a text box in which you will be able to enter text (See sample below). Put the URL link to your project GitHub repository and the URL link to your MS Streams screencast recording you created.
- Upload this zip file under the submission link on Moodle. You can find the submission link under the Final Project section on the Moodle page.
- Submit the zip file to Moodle before the due date. The due date can be found by clicking on the submission link on Moodle. Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
1. Only materials within this GitHub repository will be graded. (40% grade cap if missed)
3. Insufficient commits may require a live demonstration (40% grade cap if missed)
4. Late submissions incur a 10% penalty per day
